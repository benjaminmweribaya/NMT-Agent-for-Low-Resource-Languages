# NMT Agent for Low-Resource Languages

## Overview
The **NMT Agent for Low-Resource Languages** is an advanced Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system designed to enhance language accessibility by providing high-quality translations for underrepresented languages. By leveraging cutting-edge AI techniques such as transfer learning and few-shot learning, this platform enables real-time and batch translations, dataset management, and continuous model improvements through active learning and user feedback.

## Features
### 1. User Authentication & Management
- Secure user authentication (OAuth, email, social login)
- Role-based access control (Admin, Translator, Regular User)
- API key generation for developers

### 2. Translation Module
- Support for text input & translation
- Language detection for source text
- Real-time and batch translation options
- Domain-specific translation customization (medical, legal, technical, etc.)
- Translation confidence scoring
- Post-translation editing and feedback collection

### 3. Dataset Management
- Upload and store bilingual corpora
- Automatic dataset augmentation (synthetic parallel corpora)
- Dataset version control
- Community-driven data contributions and quality reviews

### 4. AI Model Training & Continuous Improvement
- Transfer learning for training NMT models
- Few-shot learning to handle low-resource language translation
- Active learning to enhance model accuracy over time
- Detection of bias and hallucination in translations
- Performance tracking using BLEU, METEOR, and TER scores

### 5. Analytics & Visualization
- Track user translation history
- Generate accuracy reports and performance metrics
- Visualize language coverage and trends with interactive dashboards

### 6. API for Developers
- REST API for programmatic access
- WebSockets for real-time translations
- Rate limiting and access control mechanisms

### 7. Community Contributions & Feedback
- Allow users to review translations and suggest corrections
- Crowdsourced data collection for training datasets
- Dedicated forum for linguists, researchers, and developers to collaborate
